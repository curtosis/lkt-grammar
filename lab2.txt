Question 1
******************************
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Word Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The words in Lakota typically appear in SOV order. As an agglutinative language where pronouns are often represented as verb morphemes, it's common for the argument arrangement SOV to not actually be observed in a sentence. The morphemic representation of the pronouns are not attached in SOV order.

wičhákhuwa
wičhá-khuwá
3PlAnimPat-3SgAgt-khuwá
3PL.ANIM.PAT-3SG.AGT-chase
'It chases them'

There are multiple ways to handle this phenomena. One is for Chris' FST to output the words with the morphemes in the same sequence as they appear in the Lakota word (wičhákhuwa -> 3PlAnimPat-3SgAgt-khuwá). In order for these sentences to parse correctly (as the morphemes in this example appear in OSV order), we would need to select V-final word order in the grammar matrix customization system. The problem with v-final is that the noun phrases are not marked with case and free of order. This would cause the grammar to overgenerate far too much. 

A second option is for the FST to generate the word with its morphemes in the proper SOV order (wičhákhuwa -> 3SgAgt-3PlAnimPat-khuwá). This choice makes sense to us because the FST already knows all of the morphological rules. This is the approach we chose to take.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lakota has five different values of number agreement: singular, dual, plural, collective and distributive. Collective and distributive can be considered subtype of plural, especially considering that In many situations, there is no distinction between them. Third person stative verbs and agentive active verbs exhibit the phenomena. The dual is only used in the first person.

'We chase me'

In order to model this, we defined three types with the default super type "number": single, dual, and plural. Two additional types were created (collective and distributive), with "plural" as a super type. With this arrangement, we can constrain a third person agent to be plural, while also allowing for it to be distributive or collective as well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Person
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lakota has three different person values: first, second and third. There is no evidence that inclusivity plays a syntactic role in the language.

To model person in Lakota, we simply chose the standard First, second, and third option and none for subtype.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gender
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The indefinite articles in Lakota exhibit five genders: animate, human, nonhuman, inanimate, and non-countable (mass). The forms for human and nonhuman are sometimes distinguishable, but often take on the same form. When the same, they can simply be considered animate. Verbs, for example, do not take a different form for human vs. non-human--only a difference between animate and inanimate.

In our model, we chose to create three genders taking the default root super type "gender": animate, inanimate, noncountable. Two additional genders were created with the super type "animate": human and nonhuman. With this arrangement, we can specify nouns as human, taking an indefinite article with gender human while the verb agreement is animate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Transitive verbs in Lakota always take two arguements: one agentive, one patientive. Intransitive verbs always take on arguements, and it may be agentive or patientive. Its case determines whether the verb is active or stative. There also exist impersonal verbs which take no arguements and ditransitive verbs, which take two.

TODO examples

Because the vast majority of verbs are either transitive and intransitive, we decided to base our case choice for the model on those. The intransitive accepts either of two cases, so split-s was an appropriate fit for our model. The impersonal and ditransitive verbs can be addressed at a later time in our tdl files.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Directive-Inverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lakota is not a direct-inverse language.

------------------------------
Noun Types
------------------------------
Most nouns in Lakota behave the same with the exception of mass nouns and prouns. Mass nouns simply have a specific gender agreement. Except for emphatic uses, pronouns are not distinct words in Lakota. They are morphological phenomenon, appearing as affixes on the verb.

TODO: MASS NOUN EXAMPLE

We created a main noun type with the person feature specified as 3rd. For mass nouns, we used that main noun class as a supertype, and, as described above, defined the gender value noncountable.

------------------------------
Verb Types
------------------------------
The verbs in Lakota can be categorized in three different ways. Active instransitive, stative instransitive and active transitive. As a split-s language, the intransitive verbs may take either an agentive or patientive cased argument. Those cases satisfy active and stative verbs respectively. Transitive verbs always take two arguments: one argument each in the agentive and patientive case. There also exist special transitive verbs that take two patientientive arguements.

We created three verb types for our Lakota model. One type for transitive verbs that requires two arguments: agentive and patientive. We did not created a type for the transitive verb that requires two patientive arguments, because the customization tool did not allow it (discussed below). Because we had designated our language a split-s case system, the intransitive verb types were easy to implement. We created an itr-stative type that has a patientive argument, and a itr-active that has an agentive argument. 

------------------------------
Determiners
------------------------------
Lakota has only one definte article (except for semantic differences). The indefinite articles are quite complex, on the other hand. Factors including number, person, time, gender, and negation all play a role in the indefinite article's agreement. 

TODO examples

For our Lakota model, only one definite article was implemented. As described below, most of the variables in the indefinite article form were not able to be accounted for in the model. For this reason, we created a separate indefinite article for singular and plural, as all genders within those are identical.

Question 4
******************************
One of the places where the customization system is not able to address the grammar of Lakota is in the non-standard argument structures. As mentioned above, the core case marking system in Lakota is type Split-S, which allows for one or two verb arguments. However, there are certain verbs (called "impersonal") that take zero arguments. For example, the English sentence "It is night" can be expressed in Lakota as one simple word, "Haŋhépi." This sentence does not parse with our current grammar, as the customization system will not allow for additional argument structures. Similarly, our grammar will not parse the (uncommon) ditransitive verbs that exist in Lakota. The grammar can handle the unspecified transitive, that would cover our patientive-patientive transitive verbs, however it would also allow other combinations of argument cases that we do not want to allow. Of course there would also be an issue of overgeneration. All of these verb types can later be added to our grammar by editing the appropriate tdl file.

A second phenomena that the customization system was not able to cope with was the negative polarity of Lakota's indefinite articles. To further complicate matters, articles taking on the negative form occur in complementary distribution with a semantic "time" feature (real versus hypothetical), existing only in positive polarity. The following examples demonstrate the negative and time paradigms of the indefinite article:

šuŋkawakȟáŋ waŋ bluhá.
horse            IDF have-1SG.AGT
'I have a (real) horse.'

šuŋkawakȟáŋ waŋží luhá he?
horse            IDF.HYP have-2SG.AGT Q
'Do you have a horse?'

šuŋkawakȟáŋ waŋžíni bluhá šni.
horse            IDF.NEG have.1SG.AGT NEG
'I do not have a horse.'

Finally, we weren't able to create a transiti
